Newspaper readers who are given real prose to read are like a deaf person at a Puccini opera: they may like a few things, but they will ask themselves, "What's the point?"

The age of open information is like a verbally unruly person: the fewer people listening to them, the more they talk.

The Dark Ages are full of information: in 2010, only English was600 thousand books have been printed, but only a few have memorable quotes.

I recently had dinner at a fancy restaurant with fancy dishes and fancy names (we spent $125 per person), and then we had pizza straight from the oven for $7.95.

Those who cannot do should not teach.

***

The ancients knew very well that the only way to understand events is to cause them.

***

Someone who makes a prediction or expresses an opinion and at the same time does not risk anything sounds a bit false. If he does not risk going down with the ship, then for him it will be like watching an adventure film.

For Seneca, the Stoic sage should withdraw from public struggle when he is not listened to and the state is completely and irrevocably corrupted. It is wiser to wait for its self-destruction.
